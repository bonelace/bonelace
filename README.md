<p align="center">

  Hi hello, my name is Felix or Kevin, I also go by the name Shuichi so feel free to use any of those said names ^_^
  I'm an adult, currently having my 21st year on this planet, other than that  I go by **He** / **They** / It, please use these on me, but also feel free to ask for my pronouns, also I am happily taken by my beloved Zane, we're been together so long, so please do not interat with me if you only want a friend to flirt with, I am NOT comfortable with that.
  
  Other thing to be mentionet I am a DID system, so there's moment when I am not the one in front, you may ask who's fronting currently but if you see someone having "introj" in their name, that pretty much not me but my headmate, please respect their interaction status if they have it in name such as DNI or IWC.

  I am a sensitive person I may state that out, so I need tonetags mostly at jokes as I can't read off from tones, I tried to train that but I still have issues to tell off from tone, sometime I am passive agressive, please beware of that, it's nothing personal but is how I react to negative things that happened around me, I will apologize a lot after wards, I know that also can be annoying, but that's just my personality and life issues, beside the fact I am ANTISOCIAL. which means i don't interact with people.

I don't really have dni list, it's basically the usual dni citerias, such as homophobic, racist and etc, but I would also prefer if minors don't interact with me, I am not really comfortable with kids or teens (there are exceptions.) -16 is a big no no and dni to me, so don't even bother to interact with me, I won't be open for that, same goes for 25+ people, please forget that I even exist and breath.

  I am passionate about my partner so I mostly will try to stuck with him most of the time, but feel free to whisper if you want to interact with me, I don't promise I will replyasap as I might be off-tab or distracted, but if I can I will reply! I am usually dry talker at first, once I warm up I might be a yapper in the end, if you dislikes yappers, just tell me sybau and I will shut up right away, and probably will be awkward but yeah for the comfort just tell me shut up.

  okay well that's all actually to know, if you want to like complain about my existance like many people did on my strawpage, use my atabook for that to do so, altho I will ignore it because I am that nice + literally morally tired of people trying to play doctor on me, if you want to play a doctor then respectfully fuck off, I am NOT interested in your bullshit, nor anyone else are, hope y'all have a nice day / evening ^_^
